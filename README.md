# JavaScript Function Handling Falsy Values

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript issue related to handling falsy values within function arguments. The initial `bug.js` file shows a function that correctly manages `null` values but overlooks other falsy values like `0`, `false`, or empty strings.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides an improved version which explicitly checks for these additional falsy values, enhancing the function's robustness and reliability.
